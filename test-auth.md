# Authentication Fix Test

## Issue Fixed
The previous issue where users needed to refresh the page after signing in to see the dashboard has been resolved.

## Root Cause
The login and signup pages were directly manipulating localStorage without using the AuthContext, which meant:
1. The authentication state in the context wasn't being updated
2. The UI didn't re-render to show the dashboard
3. Users had to refresh the page to see the updated state

## Solution
Updated both login and signup pages to use the AuthContext's authentication functions:

### Login Page Changes:
- Added `import { useAuth } from "@/contexts/auth-context"`
- Added `const { login } = useAuth()`
- Replaced direct localStorage manipulation with `await login(email, password)`

### Signup Page Changes:
- Added `import { useAuth } from "@/contexts/auth-context"`
- Added `const { signup } = useAuth()`
- Replaced direct localStorage manipulation with `await signup(name, email, password)`

## Expected Behavior
1. User visits login page
2. Enters credentials and clicks "Sign In"
3. Authentication state is updated via AuthContext
4. User is redirected to dashboard
5. Dashboard appears immediately without needing a refresh

## Test Steps
1. Clear browser localStorage
2. Visit /signup and create a new account
3. After successful signup, you should see the dashboard immediately
4. Log out and try logging in via /login
5. After successful login, you should see the dashboard immediately

## Verification
The fix ensures that:
- AuthContext state is properly updated
- UI re-renders automatically
- No page refresh is needed
- Authentication flow is consistent across the application
